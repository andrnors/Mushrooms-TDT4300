# ## Problem
# 
# You are given a dataset `mushrooms.csv` with characteristics/attributes of mushrooms, and your task is to implement, train and evaluate a decision tree classifier able to say whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible based on its attributes.
# 
# ## Dataset
# 
# The dataset of mushroom characteristics is freely available at [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification) where you can find further information about the dataset. It consists of 8124 mushrooms characterized by 23 attributes (including the class). Following is the overview of attributes and values:
# 
# * class: edible=e, poisonous=p

# 
# Let's load the dataset into so called Pandas dataframe.

# In[ ]:


mushrooms_df = pd.read_csv('mushrooms.csv')


# Now we can take a closer look at the data.

# In[ ]:


mushrooms_df


# You can also print an overview of all attributes with the counts of unique values.

# In[ ]:


mushrooms_df.describe().T


# The dataset is pretty much balanced. That's a good news for the evaluation.

# ## Dataset Preprocessing
# 
# As our dataset consist of nominal/categorical values only, we will encode the strings into integers which again should simplify our implementation.

# In[ ]:


def encode_labels(df):
    import sklearn.preprocessing
    encoder = {}
    for col in df.columns:
        le = sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder()
        le.fit(df[col])
        df[col] = le.transform(df[col])
        encoder[col] = le
    return df, encoder    

mushrooms_encoded_df, encoder = encode_labels(mushrooms_df)


# In[ ]:

# ## Dataset Splitting
# 
# Before we start with the implementation of our decision tree algorithm we need to prepare our dataset for the training and testing.
# 
# First, we divide the dataset into attributes (often called features) and classes (often called targets). Keeping attributes and classes separately is a common practice in many implementations. This should simplify the implementation and make the code understandable.

# In[ ]:


X_df = mushrooms_encoded_df.drop('class', axis=1)  # attributes
y_df = mushrooms_encoded_df['class']  # classes
X_array = X_df.as_matrix()
y_array = y_df.as_matrix()


# And this is how it looks like.

# In[ ]:


print('X =', X_array)
print('y =', y_array)


# Next, we need to split the attributes and classes into training sets and test sets.
# 
# **Exercise:**
# 
# Implement the holdout splitting method with shuffling.
